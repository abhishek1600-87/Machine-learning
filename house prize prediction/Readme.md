**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and other property attributes. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate property prices to assist in real estate decision-making. 

**Objective**

Analyze and preprocess the housing dataset.

Explore correlations between different features and target values.

Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

Compare model performance and select the most accurate one.

**Technologies Used**

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

Scikit-learn (for ML algorithms)

Jupyter Notebook

**Project Workflow**

Data Collection: Imported the dataset containing housing features and prices.

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and normalized numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized feature relationships and patterns using plots and correlation heatmaps.

Model Building: Implemented models such as

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Model Evaluation: Compared models using performance metrics like RÂ² Score, MAE, and RMSE.

Model Selection: Chose the best-performing model for predicting house prices.

**Results**

Achieved high prediction accuracy using ensemble learning methods.

Visualized predicted vs actual price trends to validate model performance.

**Key Learnings**

Enhanced understanding of feature engineering and data preprocessing.

Improved practical skills in model evaluation and selection.

Gained experience in data-driven problem solving using Machine Learning.

**Future Improvements**

Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for real-time predictions.

Add more features like location mapping or economic indicators for better accuracy.

Integrate with a database for dynamic data updates.
