**Overview**

This project focuses on building a Spotify Song Recommendation System using Machine Learning techniques. The system suggests songs that are similar to a given track based on their audio features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and valence.

The aim is to enhance the music listening experience by providing personalized and data-driven song recommendations.

**Objectives**

Analyze and preprocess Spotify song dataset.

Extract and understand important audio features.

Implement a recommendation algorithm based on song similarity.

Build a function to recommend songs similar to a user-selected track.

**Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

**Project Workflow**

Data Collection

Used a Spotify dataset containing multiple track features like tempo, loudness, energy, danceability, and popularity.

Data Preprocessing

Cleaned missing or duplicate data.

Normalized numerical features for consistent scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature correlations using heatmaps and plots.

Identified patterns in popular or energetic tracks.

Feature Selection

Selected relevant numerical features for building the similarity model.

Model Building

Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based recommendation algorithm.

Used cosine similarity to find songs that are most similar to the input track.

Model Evaluation

Tested the system with various songs and evaluated the quality of recommendations.

User Function

Created a function to input any song and receive a list of recommended tracks.

**Results**

Built an efficient recommendation system capable of suggesting songs similar to user preferences.

Demonstrated how feature-based similarity can be used to mimic Spotify’s music recommendation logic.

**Key Learnings**

Learned how to preprocess and analyze real-world music data.

Gained hands-on experience with similarity-based recommendation systems.

Strengthened understanding of data visualization and machine learning workflows.

**Future Enhancements**

Integrate Spotify’s API to fetch live data and audio features.

Deploy the system using Streamlit or Flask for interactive use.

Add collaborative filtering techniques for more personalized recommendations.
